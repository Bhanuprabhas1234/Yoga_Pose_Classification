# 🧘‍♀️ Yoga Pose Classification in Real Time 

This is a  project to classify yoga poses **in real-time** using a webcam. It uses **MediaPipe** for detecting body landmarks and a trained **CNN-LSTM model**  using around 5000 images to recognize common yoga poses.  

The project is built with **Flask** for the web interface, and **OpenCV** to capture the video feed from the camera.
